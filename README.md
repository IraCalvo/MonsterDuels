Monster Duels is another game that I created in a mini game jam. I made this game in about two days worth of time. Monster Duels is game heavily inspired from a game that I loved growing up, Pokemon Duel on the app store. When it was taken I was extremely sad and even more sad at the fact that there hasn't really been a game that fills the same void that game left. So I made Monster Duels. As of right now theres not too much too differentiate it from base pokemon duel and is only tied to local play. As of right Monster Duels v1.0.0 serves an extreme alpha and base of the game!

Features that this game includes:
- Tile based movement
- Team Builder
- Tile detection
- Unique units
